		<h1>Bali</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>I went to Bali for my last spring break and I'll have to say it was my favorite vacation mainly because of the culture, beaches, and locals. The Balinese are extremly kind and are genuinly humble and welcoming. The ocean, while not great for snorkeling, has the best waves for surfing and the culture radiates throughout with temples and art pieces. </p>
