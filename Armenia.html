		<h1>Armenia</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>I spend 90% of my summers (around two months) in Armenia because majority of my friends and family live there. While there are no beaches or fancy restaurants, Armenia feels like my true home. Some of my favorite memories and people are there and I just wait all year until it's time to go back! The beautiful mountains and familiar people are what set it aside from other countries.</p>
