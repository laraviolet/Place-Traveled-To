		<h1>Italy</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>I have been to Italy twice now and it is defintley one of my favorite places. There is so much variety for what you can do: there are beaches, delicious restaurants, peaceful lakes, great shopping experiences, and more. The people there are so hospitable and treat you like family upon meeting. My favorite cities are Venice and Tuscany for the vibrant yet relaxing environemnt.
